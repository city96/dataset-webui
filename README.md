# LoRA Dataset Webui
This project aims to help with the creation and management of LoRa training datasets.
Scroll down to the bottom of the page for a feature overview.

***This is still in beta - please report any bugs you find***
*Pull requests are welcome. Currently everything is just cobbled together*

Roadmap:
- Refractor tag management
- Add single-image tag overrides [mostly done]
- Add superresolution/upscaling for small images

Known issues:
- No files/folders are ever deleted, leading to clutter/orphaned images
- Deleting an enite folder can break the step
- When an image is open and you save the dataset, it will throw an error and half of the files are left where they are.

## Getting started
(optional) create a venv first:
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

start either by running `start.bat` or manually using:
```
python webserver.py
```
(see `python webserver.py --help` for launch arguments)

Access the webui on the following URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/

If tagging/cropping/etc is too slow, try run `pip install onnxruntime-gpu`, but keep in mind that this will use some of your VRAM.

### download-dependencies.py
Running this script is recommended to get all features of the webui.

**using start.bat already downloads all dependencies by default**

It will gives you the option to download the following files:
- `danbooru-tags.json` and `gelbooru-tags.json` from github gist or catbox.moe.
	- You also have the option to scrape the tags from the site directly.
- `cropper.js` and `cropper.css` from Cloudflare/cdnjs.

## Updating
**Clear your browser cache between updates. It tends to leave the old scripts/css loaded**

## Folder structure

The folders created are meant to be used as follows:
- `0 - raw` - raw images from the internet / screenshots
- `1 - cropped` - cropped images (1:1 aspect ratio)
- `2 - sorted` - images grouped by quality / topic / etc
- `3 - tagged` - `.txt` or `.json` files containing autotagger output
- `4 - fixed` - pruned tags in `.txt` format.
- `5 - out` - scaled down images and pruned tags - point your training script here
- `datasets` - all your datasets are saved here

## Features:
Some of these images/videos might be outdated. There's also in UI tooltips.
If something breaks just open an issue here on Github.

### Dataset manager
- Save / load datasets you're working on
- Avoid having to change training folder, just point your training script at the `5 - out` folder and load the right dataset
- Write notes for yourself

### Cropping
- Crop images in your browser
- Edit already cropped images
- Duplicate image - crop two separate parts
- Quickly set the cropped area, copy it from the previous image
- Keyboard shortcuts

#### Auto cropping
- This is a good "baseline" to work from
- You can go back and quickly fix what it misses
- It can detect multiple subjects.

### Sorting
- add categories
- quickly sort multiple images, captcha style
- hit detection can be janky

#### Auto sorting
- Don't want to do it manually? Set the tags and sort automatically.

### Tagging
#### CPU-only autotagger
- A bit slow but does not take any vram, doesn't influence training.
- The output isn't realtime, I think it can do about 1 image/sec on my 11gen i5

#### Tag pruning
- Prune useless tags from the autotagger
- Normalize tags
- Quickly blackist/whitelist tags
- Replace tags on all images
- Edit rules, test the effects

### Output
- Scale images to required training resolution
